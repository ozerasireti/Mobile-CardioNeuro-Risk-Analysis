# Mobile-CardioNeuro-Risk-Analysis# Mobile Cardio-Neuro Early Risk Analysis System

This project is a prototype system developed for TÜBİTAK project proposal.

## Purpose
To analyze early cardiovascular and neurological risk indicators using:

- Pulse simulation
- ECG image processing
- Reaction time logic
- Risk scoring algorithm

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## System Flow
User → Sensor / ECG Data → Signal Processing → Risk Scoring → Result

⚠️ This system does NOT provide medical diagnosis.
It only provides early risk indicators.

## Future Development
- Real wearable device integration
- AI-based ECG classification
- Mobile app deployment
